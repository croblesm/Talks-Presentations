# SQL Saturday# 695 - Guatemala February 2018

Here are the details of the two sessions presented on February 03rd of 2018:

## [Advanced SQL Server troubleshooting with DMVs](Advance%20SQL%20Server%20troubleshooting%20with%20DMVs)
This is an intro session, where I explore the options that Microsoft Azure offers when deploying SQL Server solutions in the cloud.

## [SQL Server health check](SQL%20Server%20Health%20check)
This session is about with SQL Server running on Docker containers or Kubernetes. This is topic that I personally enjoy very much to talk about, because is what database experts call “The Future of Database Infrastructure”.
