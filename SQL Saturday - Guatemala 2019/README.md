# SQL Saturday# 595 - Guatemala February 2019

Here are the details of the two sessions presented on February 16th of 2019:

## [Azure Fundamentals for the SQL Server DBA](Azure%20Fundaments%20for%20the%20SQL%20Server%20DBA)
This is an intro session, where I explore the options that Microsoft Azure offers when deploying SQL Server solutions in the cloud.

## [SQL Server containers on Docker, Kubernetes and more](SQL%20Server%20containers%20on%20Docker%2C%20Kubernetes%20and%20more)
This session is about with SQL Server running on Docker containers or Kubernetes. This is topic that I personally enjoy very much to talk about, because is what database experts call “The Future of Database Infrastructure”.
