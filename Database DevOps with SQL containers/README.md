# PASS Summit 2019
## [Working with SQL Server containers to build database solutions](https://www.pass.org/summit/2019/Learn/SessionDetails.aspx?name=working-with-sql-server-containers-to-build-database-solutions&sid=92481)

Containers are no longer the future, they are the present and are here to change the way DBAs used to think about building SQL Server solutions. Spending long periods of time installing, configuring, and preparing databases and SQL Server instances is no longer the case with containers. 

In this session, you will learn the basic and advanced methods to deploy a SQL Server solution using containers in minutes. We will explore the options and tools (open source) we have available when working with SQL Server running on Docker containers through real world scenarios, like backing up\restoring databases, high availability, version upgrades, and the most important portability between cross platforms.

## **Prerequisites**  
* Basic experience with Linux
* Basic familiarity with shell scripting
* DBA / database developer experience with SQL Server

## **Demos**  
* [01 - Custom SQL Server container](Demo_01)
* [02 - Custom SQL Server image](Demo_02)
* [03 - Manual app integration (Docker compose)](Demo_03)
* [04 - CI with Jenkins](Demo_04)
* [05 - CI / CD with Jenkins and Kubernetes](Demo_05)

## Note
Special thanks to [Geovani de Leon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/geovani-de-le√≥n-5a315359/) from Guatemala üá¨üáπ for the help, developing the frontend (Angular) and backend (C#) part of this demo HR application. üëç üöÄ

Please take a moment to check [Geovani GitHub's repository](https://github.com/yovafree). He is a really talented developer promoting OpenSource and .NET Core. [Here is the original app repository](https://git.io/JezQC) that I used in my [Demo 03](Demo_03), it is really amazing to say that Geovani built this app entirely remotely. In fact he just pulled the SQL Server image I pushed into [my public DockerHub repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/crobles10/hr-db-dev_stg) to build his part of this stack.
